# 🕒 Time Series Data Preparation for LLM Analysis

This repository provides a streamlined approach to prepare time series data for analysis using Large Language Models (LLMs). By leveraging natural language interfaces and prompt engineering, this method enables LLMs to understand, process, and forecast time series trends effectively.

## 📌 Project Overview

The project demonstrates how to transform raw time series data into a format consumable by LLMs and convert model outputs back into structured numerical forecasts. This end-to-end pipeline includes:

- **Normalization** of input time series
- **Serialization** of numerical data into string format
- **Prompting an LLM** with the serialized data
- **Deserialization** of LLM output into numerical values
- **Inverse transformation** to retrieve original scale forecasts
